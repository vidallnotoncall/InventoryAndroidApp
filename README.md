# InventoryAndroidApp
inventory application for cs370
This application is an inventory application that saves users inventory items and allows for login and editing of not only the items but the new inventory. There were at least 4 screens that
were essential to the core of the app. The login screen, the inventory screen showing the list of inventories, and the item view which details each item. When looking at my app I started by creating a few layout sketches first and formost. I then designed the backend and then after that production of the application could begin. To ensure my code was functional I made sure to get rid of the red sections in Android studio.
